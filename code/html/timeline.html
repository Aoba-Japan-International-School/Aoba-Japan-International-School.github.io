            <h1>1976 – FOUNDING OF AOBA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL</h1>
            <p>Aoba International School was founded by Regina Doi. The school initially offered nursery to pre-first grade classes. Mrs. Doi aimed to provide a four-year bilingual early childhood education primarily for Japanese children, helping them build English skills to thrive in either international and Japanese schools. Located near the American School and several Japanese kindergartens, Aoba quickly gained popularity among both international and local families. Due to its early success, parents encouraged Mrs. Doi to expand the school’s offerings.</p>
